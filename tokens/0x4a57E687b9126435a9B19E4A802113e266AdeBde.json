It was originally developed to collateralize retail payments on the Flexa network. The Flexa network reportedly uses Flexacoin (FXC) to enable instant and fraud-free point-of-sale transactions at merchants worldwide, with a view towards achieving a long-term vision of making cryptocurrency spendable everywhere. Flexacoin (FXC) is used to stake wallets on the Flexa network.
