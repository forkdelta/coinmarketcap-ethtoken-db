CargoX describes itself as an independent blockchain courier service that competes with the likes of DHL, Fedex, and UPS. Established in Jan 2018, the CargoX dApp uses Ethereum for transferring digital original documents. Initially focused on the global freight and supply chain documents, the company, in 2019, began expanding its BDTS (blockchain document transaction system) solution to verticals like air cargo, with a view towards providing a universal solution for document ownership transfer that is reportedly fast, safe, reliable and cost-effective. BDTS's smart contracts provide audit logs of all sent documents and can prove that the documents were genuine and not tampered with during the transfer.\nCargoX aims to allow anyone to send digital documents to anyone in the world within seconds.
