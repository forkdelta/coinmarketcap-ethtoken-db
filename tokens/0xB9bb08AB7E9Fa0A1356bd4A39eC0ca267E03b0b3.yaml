description: "PCHAIN describes itself as a native multichain system with EVM support. It is designed to\
  \ make large scale blockchain applications possible. The PCHAIN mainnet was launched on 30 Mar 2019.\
  \ \nPCHAIN was founded by a team that has reportedly published 100 IEEE ACM papers and international\
  \ patents. PCHAIN claims to have been granted 6 patents. As of 1 Apr 2019, the PCHAIN team is based\
  \ in Singapore, Shanghai, State of Qatar &amp; Silicon Valley. It has 70K+ followers in Bihu (a Chinese\
  \ social platform ) and 60K+ followers in Telegram from nearly one hundred countries.\nPCHAIN has reportedly\
  \ received strategic investments from global funds such as FBG, Plug&amp;Play;, LD Capital, JRR, Genesis,\
  \ Bixin and LinkVC,etc. PCHAIN also received the Silicon Valley’s“Most Promising Blockchain Foundation\
  \ Platform 2018”award and was hailed as the“Best Blockchain Platform in 2018” by Bitcoinist. PCHAIN\
  \ has board collaboration with over 30 blockchain partners such as North America Blockchain Association,\
  \ IEEE, CFLP, etc.\nKey features include:\n- Native EVM multichain that enables the interoperability\
  \ of child chain and main chain. It can reportedly support 256+ child chains in testnet 1.0 with 1064\
  \ nodes globally. The project claims that the network supports 126K TPS and can be scaled linearly as\
  \ the number of child chains increases.\n- Patented PDBFT algorithm that combines VRF+BLS+BFT is reportedly\
  \ able to support more nodes than traditional PBFT algorithms.\n- Oracle mechanism based on the knowledge\
  \ graph reportedly makes it easier to encapsulate smart contracts - W3C compliant smart data addresses\
  \ the issue of non-intelligence in smart contracts\n- Safe Delegation and Blind Bidding that reportedly\
  \ enables a fair and secure validator election during epoch switches.\n- Cross-chain capability. The\
  \ smart contracts of PCHAIN can purportedly be invoked with other non-native tokens (BCH, ERC20) by\
  \ using the provided toolkit."
