description: 'Block Array, via its FreightTrust logistics platform (https://freighttrust.net/), is looking
  to bring the benefits of blockchain technology to the trucking industry. The primary focus of FreightTrust
  is to eliminate paper from supply chain operations and thereby help to streamline operations while cutting
  down on financial and resource waste. This will be achieved by implementing Smart Contract Bills of
  Lading as well as other digitized shipping documents. Additional features include predictive A.I., a
  blockchain audit trail, and on-chain payments and financial management.

  The ARY token acts as a digital software license, which resides on the Ethereum platform.

  Initial primary target markets are the USA and EU due to their prominent trucking industries, with other
  global markets likely to be tackled later.

  Block Array HQ is based in Chattanooga, TN. For more information on the token and platform please visit
  BlockArray.com and FreightTrust.net.'
