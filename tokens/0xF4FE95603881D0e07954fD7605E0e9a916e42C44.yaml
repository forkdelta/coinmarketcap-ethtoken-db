description: WhenHub Interface aims to facilitate the transfer of knowledge between consumers and experts.
  Knowledge-sharing is done via video calls, with the financial details handled by smart contracts that
  use the WHEN Token. Callers can book a time slot for a future video call with experts. WhenHub Interface's
  goal is to give gig-economy workers the opportunity to earn money at their convenience.
