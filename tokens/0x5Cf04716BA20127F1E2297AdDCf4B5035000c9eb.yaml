description: 'NKN bills itself as a ''new kind of P2P network connectivity protocol'' that is powered
  by a public blockchain. NKN is used to incentivize Internet users to share their network connection
  and unused bandwidth. NKN''s describes its networking infrastructure as ''open, efficient, and robust'',
  thereby enabling application developers to build the decentralized Internet. Whitfield Diffie, inventor
  of public key cryptography (Diffie-Hellman) and 2015 Turing Award winner, and Stephen Wolfram, Founder
  and CEO of Wolfram Research, are listed on their publications as advisors for the project.
