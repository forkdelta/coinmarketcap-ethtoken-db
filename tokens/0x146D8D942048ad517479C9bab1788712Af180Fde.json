According to the Hong Kong-based team, anyone can participate by clicking on the 'MIB App download' button to start MIB Mining. The Mobile SmartX Blockchain Platform reportedly allows users to send and receive MIB, make payments/transactions in a mobile environment. The intention is to obviate the need for costly mining-equipment such as hardware, CPU, GPU, and ASICS. The team aims to prevent the monopolization of the crypto space by specific entities and states by facilitating MIB mining on mobile devices. The team believes that a distributed mobile blockchain system enables a low cost and high-efficient blockchain network.","id":3210,"links":{"Announcement":"https://www.mibcoin.io/news/","Chat":"https://t.me/joinchat/DNeZgA-RivbU3EOQfl-wIQ","Explorer":"https://etherscan.io/token/0x146d8d942048ad517479c9bab1788712af180fde","Explorer 2":"https://ethplorer.io/address/0x146d8d942048ad517479c9bab1788712af180fde","Explorer 3":"https://www.mibscan.com/","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/mibcoin","Website":"https://www.mibcoin.io/"},"markets":[{"exchange_name":"CoinBene","pair":"MIB/BTC","url":"https://www.coinbene.com/exchange.html#/exchange?pairId=MIBBTC"},{"exchange_name":"Coinsuper","pair":"MIB/ETH","url":"https://www.coinsuper.com/#/actionDeal"},{"exchange_name":"IDCM","pair":"MIB/BTC","url":"https://www.idcm.io/trading/MIB_BTC"},{"exchange_name":"ProBit Exchange","pair":"MIB/KRW","url":"https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/MIB-KRW"},{"exchange_name":"ProBit Exchange","pair":"MIB/USDT","url":"https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/MIB-USDT"}],"name":"MIB Coin","rank":814,"symbol":"MIB","tags":["Coin"],"website_slug":"mib-coin"}
