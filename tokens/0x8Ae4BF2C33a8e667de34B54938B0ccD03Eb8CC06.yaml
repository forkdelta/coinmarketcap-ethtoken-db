description: 'PTOY is the native token of the PTOYNet private permissioned blockchain storage network
  and currency fuel of the platform. In exchange for PTOY, users (which include patients and healthcare
  organizations) will be able to use the network to rent health information storage space and execute
  health-specific smart contract payments/transactions.

  PTOY aims to drive the PTOYNET''s value towards interoperability and cybersecurity. This system intends
  to eliminate the friction and costs of current third‑party intermediaries when considering population
  health management. The storage network promises improved data integrity, reduced transaction costs,
  decentralization, and disintermediation of transparency/trust and directs the healthcare stakeholders
  to securely manage electronic medical data.'
