description: 'HLC is ERC20 Token of Qitmeer Network.


  Qitmeer is the next generation-public chain based on Block DAG which is dedicated to serving the ecosystem
  of Inclusive finance and Islamic Finance.


  In contrast to the competition model, BlockDAG’s collaboration model in the mining achieves a desirable
  balance of typical blockchain metrics among the security, openness, fairness and scalability.


  Qitmeer adopts a classic POW consensus and UTXO data model and designs a unique asset issuing mechanism
  which requires the reserve of base currency, which is in line with core ethical financial values.'
