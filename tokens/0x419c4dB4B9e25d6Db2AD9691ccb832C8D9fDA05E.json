DragonChain is providing the serverless ecosystem that allows companies to start using blockchain applications in an easy, private, and secure way. They aim to give businesses a \u201cturn-key\u201d product that is compatible with the development stack that companies are currently used to like Java, C++, and Python. This means that businesses will now be able to build their own smart contracts (on the DragonChain platform) using common programming languages.\nDragonChain (DRGN) is a blockchain-based company and ecosystem originally developed by Disney in 2014.
