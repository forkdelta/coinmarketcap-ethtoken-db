description: 'FLETA describes itself as a public blockchain platform that also provides technology and
  business support services to blockchain projects. Designed with the goal of creating the most developer-friendly
  environment that is scalable, efficient and cost-effective, FLETA aims to accelerate the mass adoption
  of blockchain technology. Its technology stack includes an independent multi-chain structure, block
  redesign, LEVEL Tree validation, parallel sharding, and a proprietary consensus algorithm (Proof-of-Formulation
  - PoF). Additionally, FLETA aims to enhance interoperability by enabling projects that are built and
  issued on other mainnets to provide their services on FLETA''s service chain while maintaining their
  existing mainnets.
