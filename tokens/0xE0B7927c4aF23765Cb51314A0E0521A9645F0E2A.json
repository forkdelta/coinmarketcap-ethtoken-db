The project provides the infrastructure to create tokens backed by physical assets on the blockchain. To wit, it allows for the public verification of an asset\u2019s existence through its chain of custody via its Proof of Provenance (PoP) protocol, which makes use of the Ethereum network and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Digix also offers an API that enables other applications to be built on top of its asset tokenization service. Digix has 2 cryptocurrencies, Digix Gold (DGX) and DigixDAO (DGD). The company reportedly procures its gold from LBMA-approved refiners. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. The DGD crowdsale in Mar 2016 was the first crowdsale and major DAO hosted on the Ethereum network.\nFounded in Singapore in Dec 2014, DigixDAO (DGD) is building a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that specializes in the tokenization of physical assets.
