description: Optimal Shelf Availability Token (OSA) is a decentralized, AI-driven blockchain platform
  that collects and analyzes data from retailers, manufacturers, consumers and open sources purportedly
  in real-time. The token serves a tri-fold purpose as the network's fuel, a payment method, and reward
  for users of the platform. According to OSA marketing materials, consumers will enrich OSA's AI data
  model by providing relevant product information and purchase decision tree, and in turn, the AI will
  analyze this data so that manufacturers and retailers may effectively cooperate to optimize their own
  business strategies.
